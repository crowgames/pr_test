    <h1>Exploit/Demo: Forced double spending through wrong retry implementation.</h1>
    <p>For this demo, two different payment handlers should be installed:</p>
      <a href="https://rsolomakhin.github.io/pr/apps/origin/" target="_blank">https://rsolomakhin.github.io/pr/apps/origin/</a><br>
      <a href="https://rsolomakhin.github.io/pr/apps/bobpay/" target="_blank">https://rsolomakhin.github.io/pr/apps/bobpay/</a>
    <p>Price: USD <strong>$1.00</strong> <em>(tentative)</em></p>
    <p><button onclick="onBuyClicked()">Buy</button></p>
  </div>
  <pre id="msg"></pre>
  <div id="explanation" style="display: none;">
    Through using the retry method, the user stays in one payment request. <br>
    According to the specification, the payment handler can not be changed during retry (see specification and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/payment-request/issues/882#issuecomment-549197510" target="_blank">here</a>).<br>
    The payment handlers would normally identify a retry through the reoccurence of the same payment request id (see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/payment-request/issues/882#issuecomment-549066460" target="_blank">here</a>).
    Since the second payment handler can not use this method since it didn't observe the first payment request, it will treat this request as a new one.
    This leads to unintended double spending, that a malicious website could use to obtain more money than intended.
